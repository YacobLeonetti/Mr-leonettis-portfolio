        <p class="infoonme">Hello! My name is Jacob Leonetti and I am taking a coding bootcamp thorugh the University of Oregon. I have always had a really big passion for computers. I would build my friends computers and work on them when they wouldnt work properly. Throughout highschool I took a networking class and I didn't really catch on to that to much. So I started looking at professions that were a little more in depth than just building computers. I started looking at software engineering jobs and kinda liked what I saw. So I started to watch some videos on it and I've heard that the biggest fear factor of this profession is the mental stress and burnouts, but im really determined to get through this course no matter how hard it gets. So far the people I have met in this bootcamp are so helpful. Being a new "coder" I was really nervous on asking questions about things, but everyone is super supportive and helpful.</p>
